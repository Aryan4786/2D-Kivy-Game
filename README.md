# 2D-Kivy-Game
The project contains a 2D game made using Kivy (Python framework for NUI development)                                                                                               
Before Running the main.py file:-                                                                                                                                                   
STEP 0: Open the TERMINAL                                                                                                                                                           
STEP 1: Creating a virtual Environment (python -m virtualenv name_of_folder)                                                                                                       
STEP 2: Setting up the execution policy (Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process)                                                                                           
STEP 3: Activating the virtual Environment (name_of_folder\Scripts\activate)                                                                                                       
STEP 4: Now navigating to the folder (cd name_of_folder)                                                                                                                           
STEP 5: Installing KIVY (pip install kivy)                                                                                                                                         
STEP 6: Copy all the files to the folder (name_of_folder)                                                                                                                           
STEP 7: Running the main.py file (Python main.py)
